\begin{enumerate}
    \item Nozzle A shows decrease and further increase in pressure across the locations. Hence, we can conclude it as a CD Nozzle.
    \item Throat of Nozzle A seems to be near location 3 as pressure decreases till that location and then starts rising for higher Pressure Ratios.
    
    \item TO write
    \item Nozzle B shows decrease and further increase in pressure across locations. Hence, it is a CD Nozzle.
    \item Throat of Nozzle B seems to be near location 2 as pressure decreases till that point and increases further.
    \item Design Pressure Ratio of Nozzle B is around 0.3 since the pressure graph goes horizontal.
    \item Nozzle C shows decrease in pressure ratios over locations indicating a convergent Nozzle.
