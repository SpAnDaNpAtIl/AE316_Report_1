Nozzle Pressure distribution Test Unit will be equipped with the following contents:
\begin{itemize}
    \item 3 Nozzles of unknown configurations with static ports and vanes at
various location to measure pressure at those locations.
    \item Pressure Gauges: Eight pressure Gauges to measure gauge pressure at
several locations.
    \item Rota Meter: Measure air flow range between 1.4 to 9.0gm/s
    \item Fixer: Nozzle is fixed to measure pressure distribution
    \item Input and output Valves
    \item Air Regulator
\end{itemize}
