% Uncommenting the \thesisTurnOffHF line below will remove your name + id from the footer

% as the presentation policy for assessed work in the SoCS requires
% these both of these. However, you may want to uncomment this for other
% reasons: i.e. when printing a personal copy which is NOT going to be
% submitted.
